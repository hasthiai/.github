# Hasthi.ai

**Collaborative, Shareable AI Contexts — Built for the LLM Era**

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of [Hasthi.ai](https://hasthi.ai) — an open ecosystem for sharing and reusing conversational contexts, prompts, and intelligent agents across Large Language Model (LLM) platforms.

## 🌐 What is Hasthi.ai?

Hasthi.ai is the **NPM for LLMs** — a registry where developers, researchers, and enthusiasts can:

- 📦 **Publish** reusable contexts, agents, and prompt packages
- 🔍 **Explore** and search through community-contributed modules
- 🤝 **Collaborate** on improving AI-powered workflows
- 🧠 **Port** your LLM knowledge across tools and clients

Whether you're building custom GPT workflows, teaching agents new behaviors, or curating long-term context libraries, Hasthi.ai provides the foundation for interoperable AI interaction.
